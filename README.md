### 2017 SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering

Under development, to be used in tutorials at the 2017 SIAM CSE Conference:

 - [Version Control with Git - Parts I and II](http://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=61491)

If you clone the repository, you should be able to open the file
`slides/part1.html` for example in any browser.

 - Part 1 is will also be used in an Applied Math Department Tutorial on February 18.
 - Part 2 is will also be used in an eScience Institute Tutorial on February 22.


### Before the tutorial:

Please do the following in preparation for the tutorial:

 - Make sure you have Git installed on your laptop, e.g. by attempting to clone this repository via:
 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/uwescience/git-tutorials-siamcse2017.git
   ```
   If you don't have Git installed, see for example [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) from the [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/) or the Software Carpentry instructions below.
   
   If you cloned the repository earlier and want to update with recent changes:
   
   ```
   cd git-tutorials-siamcse2017
   git pull
   ```
   
 - Know how to use basic command line instructions in a Unix shell, such as `cd`, `ls`, etc.  
   See for example: http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
   
 - Have an editor that you know how to use for modifying files. (e.g. nano, vim, emacs, etc.)
 
 - For Part 2, you should also have a Github account.  Create a free account at https://github.com/
 
### Tips:

 - See http://installation.software-carpentry.org/ for the software recommended for [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/about/) workshops.  We suggest following this if you don't have Git, bash, editors, etc. (especially if you are using a Windows laptop).
 - If you have a MacBook, you will need to install Xcode in order for command line tools to work.
 - The file `slides/part1.html` in this repository also contains some hints.
